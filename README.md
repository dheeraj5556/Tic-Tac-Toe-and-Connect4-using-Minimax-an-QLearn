# Tic-Tac-Toe-and-Connect4-using-Minimax-an-QLearn


1) Tic-Tac-Toe

I have created three seperate notebooks for the three comparisons:
i) MinMax vs Default  --> tictac_minmax.ipynb
ii) Q-Learning vs Default --> tictac_qlearn.ipynb
iii) MinMax vs Q-Learning --> tictac_qlearnvsmm.ipynb

---To execute all the three comparisons just open the notebook and run all---

---> You can also change the depth of minmax algorithm to try the algorithm for different depths.

2) Connect 4

I have created three seperate notebooks for the three comparisons:
i) MinMax vs Default --> connect4_minMax.ipynb
ii) Q-Learning vs Default --> connect4_qLearn.ipynb
iii) MinMax vs Q-Learning --> connect4_mmvsql.ipynb

---To execute all the three comparisons just open the notebook and run all---

******For Connect 4 you can downlaod pre trained weights of q-learning from the drive link below******

---> you can also change the depth of minmax algorithm to try the algorithm for different depths.
---> You can also use connect4_qlTrain.ipynb to train your new Q-Learn model

######For Q-Learning, whenever you run a simulation, please restart the kernel. The weights cause MemoryError######
